    <h1>Jaydon's Linux Command Cheat Sheet</h1>
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>
        I've created this webpage for three reasons. First, Erik told me to.
        Second, I want to gain a greater understanding of HTML and Linux 
        commands. Third, I really want to have this image published on the
        web if even for a brief period. Here it is: 
    </p>
    <img src="yay.png" alt="Yay Flag" height = 500 >
    <p>
        I designed this image as a flag for the common college student. He or
        she is constantly bombarded by work that seems pointless and irritating
        This flag represents the feeling of <s>enthusiam</s> 
        <span style="color:red">impending dread</span> that all college students 
        feel when they get another assignment that they don't have enough time 
        for.
    </p>

        I know this isn't very long, but it doesn't have to be. I plan to 
        continually update as time goes on.

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><pre>ls</pre> (list)</td>
            <td>Lists the contents of the current directory.</td>
            <td><pre>ls &lt;enter&gt;</pre></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><pre>cd</pre> (change directory)</td>
            <td>Moves to another directory.</td>
            <td><pre>cd ~/Desktop &lt;enter&gt;</pre></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><pre>wc</pre> (word count)</td>
            <td>Counts the number of words it is given.<br> 
            This example counts the items in a directory.</td>
            <td><pre>ls -1 | wc -l &lt;enter&gt;</pre></td>
        </tr>
