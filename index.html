    <h1>Jaydon's Linux Command Cheat Sheet</h1>
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>
        I've created this webpage for three reasons. First, Erik told me to.
        Second, I want to gain a greater understanding of HTML and Linux 
        commands. Third, I just really want to have this image published on the
        web if even for a brief period. Here it is: 
    </p>
    <img src="yay.png" alt="Yay Flag" height = 500 >
    <p>
        I created that image as a flag for the common college student. He or
        she is constantly bombarded by work that seems pointless and irritating
        This flag represents the feeling of <s>enthusiam</s> 
        <span style="color:red">impending dread</span> that all college students 
        feel when they get another assignment that they don't have enough time 
        for.
